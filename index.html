        <p><strong>Canvas Studio</strong> is an art exhibition club founded in 2018. The exhibitions include various types of art, including photography, digital art, watercolor, and even pencil art. The students had to prepare the exhibition all on their own, starting from cleaning out a classroom to putting up wallpaper, pictures, and strings of photographs. They were able to support their exhibition through a small fundraiser by selling products based on the artwork exhibited. In 2019, the members plan to raise money to help the children in the city community. They plan to provide art classes on a biweekly basis in community centers. The 2018 exhibition theme was <em>“Nature,”</em> and the 2019 exhibition theme will be <em>“School.”</em></p>
